Printing a triangle star program

In this program we are counting number of row and cloums.
WE are writing our code in main method with conditions to print triangle.



for( k=1;k<=(2*i-1);k++)
{
if(k==1||i==row||k==(2*i-1))
{
System.out.print("*");
}
else
{
System.out.print(" ");
}



In the above loop we are taking some conditions to print trianglar star
if the condition is true it will print star.
else it will print Spaces
